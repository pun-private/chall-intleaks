  > Item # SCP-173

  Object Class: Euclid
  --------------------


Special Containment Procedures: Item SCP-173 is to be kept in a locked 
container at all times. When personnel must enter SCP-173's container, 
no fewer than 3 may enter at any time and the door is to be relocked 
behind them. At all times, two persons must maintain direct eye contact 
with SCP-173 until all personnel have vacated and relocked the container.

Description: Moved to Site-**redacted**. Origin is as of yet unknown. It 
is constructed from concrete and rebar with traces of Krylon brand spray 
paint. SCP-173 is animate and extremely hostile. The object cannot move 
while within a direct line of sight. Line of sight must not be broken at 
any time with SCP-173. Personnel assigned to enter container are 
instructed to alert one another before blinking. Object is reported to 
attack by snapping the neck at the base of the skull, or by strangulation. 
In the event of an attack, personnel are to observe Class 4 hazardous 
object containment procedures.

Personnel report sounds of scraping stone originating from within the 
container when no one is present inside. This is considered normal, and 
any change in this behaviour should be reported to the acting HMCL 
supervisor on duty.

The reddish brown substance on the floor is a combination of feces and 
blood. Origin of these materials is unknown. The enclosure must be 
cleaned on a bi-weekly basis.
