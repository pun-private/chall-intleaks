to repair their own decaying bodies. In a raging inter-
galactic space-battle, SHADO attempts to save Earth from this
alien terror.

                              --------


Confirmed sightings involving Unidentified Flying Objects have 
become more frequent. When mutilated human bodies are discovered 
after a UFO attack, the Earth's governments meet to construct a 
top secret defense organization, code named SHADO (Supreme 
Headquarters, Alien Defense Organization). To command this 
incredible organization, the world leaders choose Commander Ed 
Straker (ED BISHOP). To accomplish its mission, SHADO has 
constructed a base on the Moon complete with a fleet of sub-
space interceptors, a sophisticated tracking satellite code 
named SID (Space Intruder Detector), a fleet of powerful sub-
marines complete with search and strike aircraft and a base of 
operations far below the surface of a film studio. Colonel 
Alec Freeman (GEORGE SEWELL) is sent to escort members of the 
SHADO SST but is shot down by a SHADO jet. The UFO crashes and 
a body is recovered. The body of the alien is rushed back to 
SHADO for examination and Straker makes an astonishing discovery, 
many of the alien organs are human!

-------------

The UFOs have come to Earth from a dying planet millions of 
light years away. They are looking for human organs to replace their 
own decaying organs. When SID reports another sighting, SHADO is 
ready. The Moonbase interceptors manage to damage the UFO but it 
makes it through the atmosphere, crash landing somewhere in 
northern Canada. SHADO land mobiles are sent to investigate and 
they discover the damaged alien craft in a deeply wooded area. As 
the SHADO crew investigates the ship, it tries to blast its way 
out but destroys itself upon take-off.

Then an astonishing report comes in from SID: there are 50 UFOs 
converging for a mass attack outside Earth's atmosphere. 
Meanwhile, Straker goes out in a Skydiver submarine to investigate 
an underwater power source. He discovered an underwater dome and 
when he breaks in, he is astonished to discover exact duplicates 
of SHADO personnel manning the controls. He realizes that they 
are androids programmed by the aliens to contact Moonbase and SID. 
When Straker overhears instructions being given to Moonbase to 
allow the massed UFOs through the earth's defenses without inter-
ception, the truth dawns on him. The aliens have devised a plan 
to trick Moonbase into believing that instructions are coming 
from the real SHADO control center. Straker orders the alien base 
destroyed but it is too late to prevent the UFO attack. As the 
UFOs stream towards the Moon, and intergalactic battle rages in 
space. SHADO sends their complete arsenal of war to try and 
save the Earth from the alien terror.
